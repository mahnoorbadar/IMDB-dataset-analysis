From sklearn library, tfidf is imported. TF-IDF is an abbreviation for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency. This is very common algorithm to transform 
text into a meaningful representation of numbers which is used to fit machine algorithm for prediction.
Then, Logistic Regression is imported from sklearn since it is a classification algorithm. Based on a given set of independent variables, it is used to estimate
discrete value (0 or 1, yes/no, true/false).
Cross_val_score is imported, a function in the scikit learn package, to train and test model over multiple folds of dataset.
Gaussian Naive Bayes is imported that assumes that each parameter (also called features or predictors) has an independent capacity of predicting the output variable.
XGBClassifier is used to make predictions.
